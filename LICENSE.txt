THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF 
THIS  COMMON  PUBLIC  LICENSE  ("AGREEMENT").  ANY  USE, 
REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES 
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
1. 
 
DEFINITIONS 
 
"Contribution" means: 
 
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and 
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
        i) changes to the Program, and 
        ii) additions to the Program; 
 
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from  a 
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone 
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
the  Program  which:  (i)  are  separate  modules  of  software  distributed  in 
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are 
not derivative works of the Program. 
 
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 
 
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily  infringed  by the  use or  sale  of  its  Contribution  alone or  when 
combined with the Program. 
 
"Program"  means  the  Contributions  distributed  in  accordance  with  this 
Agreement. 
 
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors. 
2. 
 
GRANT OF RIGHTS 
 
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient  a  non-exclusive,  worldwide,  royalty-free  copyright  license  to 
reproduce,  prepare  derivative  works  of,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform, 
distribute  and sublicense the  Contribution  of such  Contributor,  if any,  and 
such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient  a  non-exclusive,  worldwide,  royalty-free  patent  license  under 
Licensed  Patents  to  make,  use,  sell,  offer  to  sell,  import  and  otherwise 
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object 
code  form.  This  patent  license  shall  apply  to  the  combination  of  the 
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the 
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any 
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
licensed hereunder. 
    c)  Recipient  understands  that  although  each  Contributor  grants  the 
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by 
any  Contributor  that  the  Program  does  not  infringe  the  patent  or  other 
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any 
liability  to  Recipient  for  claims  brought  by  any  other  entity  based  on 
infringement  of  intellectual  property  rights  or  otherwise.  As  a  condition  to 
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby 
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights 
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire 
that license before distributing the Program. 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set 
forth in this Agreement. 
 
3. 
 
REQUIREMENTS 
 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
its own license agreement, provided that: 
 
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 
    b) its license agreement: 
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and 
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and 
fitness for a particular purpose; 
        ii)  effectively  excludes  on  behalf  of  all  Contributors  all  liability  for 
damages,  including  direct,  indirect,  special,  incidental  and  consequential 
damages, such as lost profits; 
        iii)  states  that  any  provisions  which  differ  from  this  Agreement  are 
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
        iv)  states  that  source  code  for  the  Program  is  available  from  such 
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner 
on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
 
When the Program is made available in source code form: 
 
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
    b)  a  copy  of  this  Agreement  must  be  included  with  each  copy  of  the 
Program. 
 
    Contributors  may  not  remove  or  alter  any  copyright  notices  contained 
within the Program. 
 
    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if 
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the 
originator of the Contribution. 
 
4. 
 
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
includes  the  Program  in  a  commercial  product  offering  should  do  so  in  a 
manner  which  does  not  create  potential  liability  for  other  Contributors. 
Therefore,  if  a  Contributor  includes  the  Program  in  a  commercial  product 
offering,  such  Contributor  ("Commercial  Contributor")  hereby  agrees  to 
defend  and  indemnify  every  other  Contributor  ("Indemnified  Contributor") 
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from 
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the 
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such 
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a 
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to 
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property 
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the 
Commercial  Contributor  to  control,  and  cooperate  with  the  Commercial 
Contributor  in,  the  defense  and  any  related  settlement  negotiations.  The 
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 
 
For  example,  a  Contributor  might  include  the  Program  in  a  commercial 
product  offering,  Product  X.  That  Contributor  is  then  a  Commercial 
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, 
or  offers  warranties  related  to  Product  X,  those  performance  claims  and 
warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this 
section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the 
other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if 
a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 
5. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
EXCEPT  AS  EXPRESSLY  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS  AGREEMENT,  THE 
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES 
OR  CONDITIONS  OF  ANY  KIND,  EITHER  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED 
INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  ANY  WARRANTIES  OR 
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR 
FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  Each  Recipient  is  solely 
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the 
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under 
this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program 
errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs 
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 
6. 
 
DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER 
RECIPIENT  NOR  ANY  CONTRIBUTORS  SHALL  HAVE  ANY  LIABILITY 
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST 
PROFITS),  HOWEVER  CAUSED  AND  ON  ANY THEORY  OF  LIABILITY, 
WHETHER  IN  CONTRACT,  STRICT  LIABILITY,  OR  TORT  (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE 
OR  DISTRIBUTION  OF  THE  PROGRAM  OR  THE  EXERCISE  OF  ANY 
RIGHTS  GRANTED  HEREUNDER,  EVEN  IF  ADVISED  OF  THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
7. 
 
GENERAL 
 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
law, it shall  not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the 
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
provision valid and enforceable. 
 
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a 
patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
lawsuit),  then  any  patent  licenses  granted  by  that  Contributor  to  such 
Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation 
is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
(including  a  cross-claim  or  counterclaim  in  a  lawsuit)  alleging  that  the 
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or 
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights 
granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is 
filed. 
 
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply 
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not 
cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such 
noncompliance.  If  all  Recipient's  rights  under  this  Agreement  terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
reasonably  practicable.  However,  Recipient's  obligations  under  this 
Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program 
shall continue and survive. 
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in 
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be 
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right 
to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to 
time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this 
Agreement.  IBM  is  the  initial  Agreement  Steward.  IBM  may  assign  the 
responsibility  to  serve  as  the  Agreement  Steward  to  a  suitable  separate

above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of 
any  Contributor  under  this  Agreement,  whether  expressly,  by  implication, 
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under

3. Distribution Obligations. 
 
3.1.  Application  of  License.  The  Modifications  which  You  contribute  are 
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. 
The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the 
terms of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with every 
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any 
terms  on  any  Source  Code  version  that  alters  or  restricts  the  applicable 
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may 
include  an  additional  document  offering  the  additional  rights  described  in 
Section 3.5. 
 
3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You contribute must 
be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either 
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version 
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must 
remain  available  for  at  least  twelve  (12)  months  after  the  date  it  initially 
became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are 
responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even 
if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
 
3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which 
you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent 
statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original 
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial 
Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable 
version  or  related  documentation  in  which  You  describe  the  origin  or 
ownership of the Covered Code. 
 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
 
(a)  Third  Party  Claims.  If  You  have  knowledge  that  a  party  claims  an 
intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization 
under  this  License),  you  must  include  a  text  file  with  the  source  code 
distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making 
the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you 
obtain  such  knowledge  after  You  make  Your  Modification  available  as 
described  in  Section  3.2,  You  shall  promptly  modify  the  LEGAL  file  in  all 
copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as 
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to 
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been 
obtained. 
 
(b)  Contributor  APIs.  If  Your  Modification  is  an  application  programming 
interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to 
implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
 
3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file 
of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source 
Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You 
created  one  or  more  Modification(s),  You  may  add  your  name  as  a 
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such 
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must 
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a 
user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and 
to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one 
or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your 
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You 
must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify 
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial  Developer  or  such  Contributor  as  a  result  of  warranty,  support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in 
Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met 
for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source 
Code  version  of  the  Covered  Code  is  available  under  the  terms  of  this 
License,  including  a  description  of  how  and  where  You  have  fulfilled  the 
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any 
notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which 
You  describe  recipients'  rights  relating  to  the  Covered  Code.  You  may 
distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your 
choice, which may contain terms different from this  License, provided that 
You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for 
the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights 
in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree 
to  indemnify  the  Initial  Developer  and  every  Contributor  for  any  liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such 
terms You offer. 
 
3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered 
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute 
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the 
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 
 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You 
to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of 
the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with 
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe 
the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in 
the  LEGAL  file  described  in  Section  3.4  and  must  be  included  with  all 
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or 
regulation,  such  description  must  be  sufficiently  detailed for  a  recipient  of 
ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
 
5. Application of this License. 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the 
notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 
 
6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE

1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License, Version 
1.0. 
 
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE 
COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE  OR  NON-INFRINGING. THE  ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO  THE  QUALITY  AND  PERFORMANCE  OF  THE  COVERED  CODE  IS

REPAIR  OR  CORRECTION.  THIS  DISCLAIMER  OF  WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES  AN  ESSENTIAL  PART  OF  THIS  LICENSE.  NO  USE  OF 
ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER. 
 
8. TERMINATION. 
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if 
You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 
days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code 
which  are  properly  granted  shall  survive  any  termination  of  this  License. 
Provisions  which,  by  their  nature,  must  remain  in  effect  beyond  the 
termination of this License shall survive. 
 
9. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
Any utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer or any 
Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor indirect). 
 
10. MISCELLANEOUS 
This  License  represents  the  complete  agreement  concerning  the  subject 
matter hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This 
License shall be construed by and in accordance with the substantive laws of 
Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this 
License, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be subject to the

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007  
-----------------------------------------------------------   
 
PREAMBLE  
The  goals  of  the  Open  Font  License  (OFL)  are  to  stimulate  worldwide 
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts 
of  academic  and  linguistic  communities,  and  to  provide  a  free  and  open 
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with 
others.   
 
The  OFL  allows  the  licensed  fonts  to  be  used,  studied,  modified  and 
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, 
including  any  derivative  works,  can  be  bundled,  embedded,    redistributed 
and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used 
by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released 
under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under 
this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their 
derivatives. 
 
DEFINITIONS  
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) 
under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, 
build scripts and documentation.   
 
"Reserved  Font  Name"  refers  to  any  names  specified  as  such  after  the 
copyright statement(s).   
 
"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as 
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).   
 
"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or 
substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original 
Version,  by  changing  formats  or  by  porting  the  Font  Software  to  a  new 
environment.   
 
"Author"  refers to  any  designer, engineer,  programmer,  technical writer  or 
other person who contributed to the Font Software.

                            Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share  and  change  it.    By  contrast,  the  GNU  General  Public  License  is 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License 
applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

program  whose  authors  commit  to  using  it.    (Some  other  Free  Software 
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License 
instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too. 
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our 
General  Public  Licenses  are  designed  to  make  sure  that  you  have  the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if 
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you  these  rights  or  to  ask  you  to  surrender  the  rights.  These  restrictions 
translate  to  certain  responsibilities  for  you  if  you  distribute  copies  of  the 
software, or if you modify it. 
 
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer 
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or 
modify the software. 
 
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients 
to  know  that  what  they  have  is  not  the  original,  so  that  any  problems 
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. 
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually 
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent 
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's 
free use or not licensed at all. 
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 
 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
TERMS  AND  CONDITIONS  FOR  COPYING,  DISTRIBUTION  AND 
MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this  General  Public  License.    The  "Program",  below,  refers  to  any  such 
program  or  work,  and  a  "work  based  on  the  Program"  means  either  the 
Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work 
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is 
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made 
by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program 
does. 
 
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as  you  receive  it,  in  any  medium,  provided  that  you  conspicuously  and 
appropriately  publish  on  each  copy  an  appropriate  copyright  notice  and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and 
to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program 
a copy of this License along with the Program. 
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions: 
 
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed 
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 
 
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, 
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such 
an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.) 
 
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable 
sections  of  that  work  are  not  derived  from  the  Program,  and  can  be 
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then 
this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute 
them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part 
of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole 
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees 
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who 
wrote it. 
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to 
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. 
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage 
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License. 
 
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Section 1 and 2 above on 
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any 
third  party,  for  a  charge  no  more  than  your  cost  of  physically  performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on 
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding  source  code.    (This  alternative  is  allowed  only  for 
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program  in object 
code  or  executable  form  with  such  an  offer,  in  accord  with  Subsection  b 
above.) 
 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source  code  for  all modules  it contains,  plus  any  associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of 
the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed 
need  not  include  anything  that  is  normally  distributed  (in  either  source  or 
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable. 
 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License 
Notices 
Wind River Confidential Information                                                                            Page 15 of 34                                                                                 Notice File Version 1.0 
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even 
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code. 
 
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly  provided  under  this  License.    Any  attempt  otherwise  to  copy, 
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies,  or  rights,  from  you  under  this  License  will  not  have  their  licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  
However,  nothing  else  grants  you  permission  to  modify  or  distribute  the 
Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do  not  accept  this  License.    Therefore,  by  modifying  or  distributing  the 
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
of  this  License  to  do  so,  and  all  its  terms  and  conditions  for  copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 
 
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program),  the  recipient  automatically  receives  a  license  from  the  original 
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and 
conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by third parties to this License. 
 
7.  If,  as  a  consequence  of  a  court  judgment  or  allegation  of  patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions  of  this  License.    If  you  cannot  distribute  so  as  to  satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of 
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, 
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 
If  any  portion  of  this  section  is  held  invalid  or  unenforceable  under  any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other  property  right  claims  or  to  contest  validity  of  any  such  claims;  this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many 
people  have  made  generous  contributions  to  the  wide  range  of  software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries 
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder 
who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical 
distribution  limitation  excluding  those  countries,  so  that  distribution  is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this 
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General  Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will  be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
problems or concerns. 
 
Each  version  is  given  a  distinguishing  version  number.    If  the  Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that  version  or  of  any  later  version  published  by  the  Free  Software 
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you  may  choose  any  version  ever  published  by  the  Free  Software 
Foundation. 
 
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose  distribution  conditions  are  different,  write  to  the  author  to  ask  for 
permission.    For  software  which  is  copyrighted  by  the  Free  Software 
Foundation,  write  to  the  Free  Software  Foundation;  we  sometimes  make 
exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the 
sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY  APPLICABLE  LAW.    EXCEPT  WHEN  OTHERWISE  STATED  IN 
WRITING  THE  COPYRIGHT  HOLDERS  AND/OR  OTHER  PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR 
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE  OF  THE  PROGRAM  IS  WITH  YOU.    SHOULD  THE 
PROGRAM  PROVE  DEFECTIVE,  YOU  ASSUME  THE  COST  OF  ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which 
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of  warranty;  and  each  file  should  have  at  least  the  "copyright"  line  and  a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 
<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands 
you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they 
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a  programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  
Here is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary  programs.    If  your  program  is  a  subroutine  library,  you  may 
consider  it  more  useful  to  permit  linking  proprietary  applications  with  the 
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is numbered 2 because 
it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL. 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share  and  change  it.  By  contrast,  the  GNU  General  Public  Licenses  are 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
make sure the software is free for all its users.  
 
This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated  Free  Software  Foundation  software,  and to  any  other  libraries 
whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.  
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General  Public  Licenses  are  designed  to  make  sure  that  you  have  the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if 
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things.  
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you  these  rights  or  to  ask  you  to  surrender  the  rights.  These  restrictions 
translate  to  certain  responsibilities  for  you  if  you  distribute  copies  of  the 
library, or if you modify it.  
 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, 
you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make 
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program 
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so 
that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library 
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.  
 
Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, 
and  (2)  offer  you  this  license  which  gives  you  legal  permission  to  copy, 
distribute and/or modify the library.  
 
Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone 
understands  that  there  is  no  warranty  for  this  free  library.  If  the  library  is 
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that 
what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by 
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.  
 
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish  to  avoid  the  danger  that  companies  distributing  free  software  will 
individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program 
into  proprietary  software.  To  prevent this,  we  have  made  it clear that  any 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  
 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, 
the  GNU  Library  General  Public  License,  applies  to  certain  designated 
libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read 
it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary 
license.  
 
The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they 
blur  the  distinction  we  usually  make  between  modifying  or  adding  to  a 
program  and  simply  using  it.  Linking  a  program  with  a  library,  without 
changing  the  library,  is  in  some  sense  simply  using  the  library,  and  is 
analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a 
textual  and  legal  sense,  the  linked  executable  is  a  combined  work,  a 
derivative  of  the  original  library,  and  the  ordinary  General  Public  License 
treats it as such.  
 
Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License 
for  libraries  did  not  effectively  promote  software  sharing,  because  most 
developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions 
might promote sharing better.  
 
However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users 
of  those  programs  of  all  benefit  from  the  free  status  of  the  libraries 
themselves.  This  Library  General  Public  License  is  intended  to  permit 
developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your 
freedom  as  a  user  of such  programs  to change  the  free  libraries that  are 
incorporated  in  them.  (We  have  not  seen  how  to  achieve  this  as  regards 
changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the 
actual  functions  of  the  Library.)  The  hope  is  that  this  will  lead  to  faster 
development of free libraries.  
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.  
Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General 
Public License rather than by this special one.  
 
TERMS  AND  CONDITIONS  FOR  COPYING,  DISTRIBUTION  AND 
MODIFICATION 
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a 
notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may 
be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so 
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of 
those functions and data) to form executables.  
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means 
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
work  containing  the  Library  or  a  portion  of  it,  either  verbatim  or  with 
modifications  and/or  translated  straightforwardly  into  another  language. 
(Hereinafter,  translation  is  included  without  limitation  in  the  term 
"modification".)  
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, 
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.  
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using 
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only 
if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use 
of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  
 
1. You may copy  and  distribute verbatim copies  of the  Library's complete 
source  code  as  you  receive  it,  in  any  medium,  provided  that  you 
conspicuously  and  appropriately  publish  on  each  copy  an  appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that 
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy 
of this License along with the Library.  
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
forming  a  work  based  on  the  Library,  and  copy  and  distribute  such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions:  
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.  
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change.  
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
third parties under the terms of this License.  
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to 
be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an 
argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good 
faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such 
function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its 
purpose remains meaningful.  
 
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
that  is  entirely  well-defined  independent  of  the  application.  Therefore, 
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used 
by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square root function must still compute square roots.) 
 
These  requirements  apply  to  the  modified  work  as  a  whole.  If  identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
considered  independent  and  separate  works  in  themselves,  then  this 
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute 
them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part 
of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole 
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees 
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who 
wrote it.  
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to 
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with 
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.  
 
 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary 
GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer 
version  than  version  2  of  the  ordinary  GNU  General  Public  License  has 
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make 
any other change in these notices.  
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so 
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies 
and derivative works made from that copy.  
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
into a program that is not a library.  
 
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under  Section  2)  in  object  code  or  executable  form  under  the  terms  of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
corresponding  machine-readable  source  code,  which  must  be  distributed 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
software interchange.  
If  distribution  of  object  code  is  made  by  offering  access  to  copy  from  a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code.  
 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called 
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative 
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of 
the  Library),  rather  than  a  "work  that  uses  the  library".  The  executable  is 
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of 
such executables.  
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
the  Library  even  though  the  source  code  is  not.  Whether  this  is  true  is 
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the 
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined 
by law.  
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether 
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
object  code  for  the  work  under  the  terms  of  Section  6.  Any  executables 
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked 
directly with the Library itself.  
 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a 
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing 
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, 
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own 
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
must  supply  a copy  of this  License. If the  work  during  execution displays 
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. 
Also, you must do one of these things:  
 
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work 
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is 
an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the 
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes 
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to 
recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  
 
c)  If  distribution  of  the  work  is  made  by  offering  access  to  copy  from  a 
designated  place,  offer  equivalent  access  to  copy  the  above  specified 
materials from the same place.  
 
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that 
you have already sent this user a copy.  
 
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need 
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form)  with  the  major  components  (compiler,  kernel,  and  so  on)  of  the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable.  
It  may  happen  that  this  requirement  contradicts  the  license  restrictions  of 
other  proprietary  libraries  that  do  not  normally  accompany  the  operating 
system.  Such  a  contradiction  means  you  cannot  use  both  them  and  the 
Library together in an executable that you distribute.  
 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-
by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by 
this  License,  and  distribute  such  a  combined  library,  provided  that  the 
separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  
 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on 
the  Library,  uncombined  with  any  other  library  facilities.  This  must  be 
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  
 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is 
a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying 
uncombined form of the same work.  
 
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who 
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  
 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However,  nothing  else  grants  you  permission  to  modify  or  distribute  the 
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do 
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or 
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License 
to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Library or works based on it.  
 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), 
the  recipient  automatically  receives  a  license  from  the  original  licensor  to 
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and 
conditions.  You  may  not  impose  any  further  restrictions  on  the  recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by third parties to this License.  
 
11.  If,  as  a  consequence  of  a  court  judgment  or  allegation  of  patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions  of  this  License.  If  you  cannot  distribute  so  as  to  satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of 
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, 
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.  
If  any  portion  of  this  section  is  held  invalid  or  unenforceable  under  any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other  property  right  claims  or  to  contest  validity  of  any  such  claims;  this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people  have  made  generous  contributions  to  the  wide  range  of  software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.  
 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries 
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder 
who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical 
distribution  limitation  excluding  those  countries,  so  that  distribution  is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this 
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  
 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions 
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns.  
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies 
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", 
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version 
or  of  any  later  version  published  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation.  If  the 
Library  does  not  specify  a  license  version  number,  you  may  choose  any 
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.  
 
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author 
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation,  write  to  the  Free  Software  Foundation;  we  sometimes  make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the 
sharing and reuse of software generally.  
 
NO WARRANTY 
 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS 
NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING 
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
LIBRARY  "AS  IS"  WITHOUT  WARRANTY  OF  ANY  KIND,  EITHER 
EXPRESSED  OR  IMPLIED,  INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO,  THE 
IMPLIED  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY  AND  FITNESS  FOR  A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries 
 
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public 
License).  
 
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line 
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the 
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version 
number 2.1.] 
 
Preamble 
 
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share  and  change  it.  By  contrast,  the  GNU  General  Public  Licenses  are 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
make sure the software is free for all its users.  
 
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated  software  packages--typically  libraries--of  the  Free  Software 
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but 
we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
based on the explanations below.  
 
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if 
you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you 
can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you are informed that you can do these things. 
 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to 
deny  you  these  rights  or  to  ask  you  to  surrender  these  rights.  These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies 
of the library or if you modify it.  
 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, 
you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make 
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code 
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so 
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library 
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.  
 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, 
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the library.  
 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else 
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.  
 
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the 
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. 
Therefore,  we  insist  that  any  patent  license  obtained  for  a  version  of  the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.  
 
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
General  Public  License.  This  license,  the  GNU  Lesser  General  Public 
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in 
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.  
 
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
derivative  of  the  original  library.  The  ordinary  General  Public  License 
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom.  The  Lesser  General  Public  License  permits  more  lax criteria  for 
linking other code with the library.  
 
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less 
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also 
provides  other  free  software  developers  Less  of  an  advantage  over 
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use 
the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.  
 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage 
the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto 
standard.  To  achieve this,  non-free  programs  must  be  allowed  to  use  the 
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely 
used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.  
 
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs 
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For 
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables 
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its 
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.  
 
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

Library  has the  freedom  and the wherewithal  to  run  that  program using  a 
modified version of the Library.  
 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order 
to run.  
 
TERMS  AND  CONDITIONS  FOR  COPYING,  DISTRIBUTION  AND 
MODIFICATION 
 
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
party saying  it may  be  distributed  under  the terms  of this  Lesser  General 
Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as 
"you". 
 
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so 
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of 
those functions and data) to form executables.  
 
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means 
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
work  containing  the  Library  or  a  portion  of  it,  either  verbatim  or  with 
modifications  and/or  translated  straightforwardly  into  another  language. 
(Hereinafter,  translation  is  included  without  limitation  in  the  term 
"modification".)  
 
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, 
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. 
 
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using 
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only 
if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use 
of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.  
 
1. You may copy  and  distribute verbatim copies  of the  Library's complete 
source  code  as  you  receive  it,  in  any  medium,  provided  that  you 
conspicuously  and  appropriately  publish  on  each  copy  an  appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that 
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy 
of this License along with the Library.  
 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.  
 
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
forming  a  work  based  on  the  Library,  and  copy  and  distribute  such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions:  
 
a)  The modified work must itself be a software library.  
 
b)  You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 
c)  You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
third parties under the terms of this License.  
 
d)  If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to 
be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an 
argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good 
faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such 
function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its 
purpose remains meaningful.  
 
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
that  is  entirely  well-defined  independent  of  the  application.  Therefore, 
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used 
by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square root function must still compute square roots.)  
 
These  requirements  apply  to  the  modified  work  as  a  whole.  If  identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
considered  independent  and  separate  works  in  themselves,  then  this 
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute 
them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part 
of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole 
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees 
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who 
wrote it.  
 
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to 
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.  
 
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with 
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.  
 
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary 
GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer 
version  than  version  2  of  the  ordinary  GNU  General  Public  License  has 
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make 
any other change in these notices.  
 
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so 
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies 
and derivative works made from that copy.  
 
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
into a program that is not a library.  
 
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under  Section  2)  in  object  code  or  executable  form  under  the  terms  of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
corresponding  machine-readable  source  code,  which  must  be  distributed 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
software interchange.  
 
If  distribution  of  object  code  is  made  by  offering  access  to  copy  from  a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code. 
 
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called 
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative 
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.  
 
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of 
the  Library),  rather  than  a  "work  that  uses  the  library".  The  executable  is 
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of 
such executables.  
 
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
the  Library  even  though  the  source  code  is  not.  Whether  this  is  true  is 
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the 
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined 
by law.  
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether 
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)  
 
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
object  code  for  the  work  under  the  terms  of  Section  6.  Any  executables 
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked 
directly with the Library itself.  
 
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing 
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, 
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own 
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.  
 
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
must  supply  a copy  of this  License. If the  work  during  execution displays 
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. 
Also, you must do one of these things:  
 
a)  Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work 
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is 
an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable 
"work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the 
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes 
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to 
recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)  
 
b)  Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable  mechanism  is  one that  (1)  uses  at  run time  a copy  of the  library 
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified 
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version 
is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.  
 
c)  Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.  
 
d)    If  distribution  of  the  work  is  made  by  offering  access  to  copy  from  a 
designated  place,  offer  equivalent  access  to  copy  the  above  specified 
materials from the same place.  
 
e)  Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that 
you have already sent this user a copy. 
 
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need 
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
form)  with  the  major  components  (compiler,  kernel,  and  so  on)  of  the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable.  
 
It  may  happen  that  this  requirement  contradicts  the  license  restrictions  of 
other  proprietary  libraries  that  do  not  normally  accompany  the  operating 
system.  Such  a  contradiction  means  you  cannot  use  both  them  and  the 
Library together in an executable that you distribute.  
 
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-
by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by 
this  License,  and  distribute  such  a  combined  library,  provided  that  the 
separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:  
 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on 
the  Library,  uncombined  with  any  other  library  facilities.  This  must  be 
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.  
 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is 
a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying 
uncombined form of the same work. 
 
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who 
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.  
 
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However,  nothing  else  grants  you  permission  to  modify  or  distribute  the 
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do 
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or 
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License 
to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Library or works based on it.  
 
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), 
the  recipient  automatically  receives  a  license  from  the  original  licensor  to 
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and 
conditions.  You  may  not  impose  any  further  restrictions  on  the  recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by third parties with this License.  
 
11.  If,  as  a  consequence  of  a  court  judgment  or  allegation  of  patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do  not excuse you from the 
conditions  of  this  License.  If  you  cannot  distribute  so  as  to  satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of 
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, 
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.  
 
If  any  portion  of  this  section  is  held  invalid  or  unenforceable  under  any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.  
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other  property  right  claims  or  to  contest  validity  of  any  such  claims;  this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people  have  made  generous  contributions  to  the  wide  range  of  software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.  
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.  
 
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries 
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder 
who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical 
distribution  limitation  excluding  those  countries,  so  that  distribution  is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this 
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.  
 
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions 
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns.

a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", 
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version 
or  of  any  later  version  published  by  the  Free  Software  Foundation.  If  the

whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author 
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation,  write  to  the  Free  Software  Foundation;  we  sometimes  make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the 
sharing and reuse of software generally.  
 
NO WARRANTY  
 
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS 
NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING 
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
LIBRARY  "AS  IS"  WITHOUT  WARRANTY  OF  ANY  KIND,  EITHER 
EXPRESSED  OR  IMPLIED,  INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO,  THE 
IMPLIED  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY  AND  FITNESS  FOR  A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE  DEFECTIVE,  YOU  ASSUME  THE  COST  OF  ALL  NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
 
16.  IN  NO  EVENT  UNLESS  REQUIRED  BY  APPLICABLE  LAW  OR 
AGREED  TO  IN  WRITING  WILL  ANY  COPYRIGHT  HOLDER,  OR  ANY 
OTHER  PARTY  WHO  MAY  MODIFY  AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE  THE 
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING  ANY  GENERAL,  SPECIAL,  INCIDENTAL  OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY 
TO  USE  THE  LIBRARY  (INCLUDING  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO  LOSS  OF 
DATA  OR  DATA  BEING  RENDERED  INACCURATE  OR  LOSSES 
SUSTAINED  BY  YOU  OR  THIRD  PARTIES  OR  A  FAILURE  OF  THE 
LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH 
HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
 
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries 
 
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can 
redistribute  and  change.  You  can  do  so  by  permitting  redistribution  under 
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public 
License).  
 
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line 
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.  
 
<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.> Copyright 
(C) <year> <name of author>  
 
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the 
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free 
Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any 
later version. 
 
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General 
Public License for more details. 
 
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA  
 
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  
 
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. 
Here is a sample; alter the names:

License text 
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed. 
This  version  of  the  GNU  Lesser  General  Public  License  incorporates  the 
terms  and  conditions  of  version  3  of  the  GNU  General  Public  License, 
supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 
0. Additional Definitions. 
 
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General 
Public License. 
 
“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than 
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. 
An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the 
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass 
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface 
provided by the Library. 
 
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application 
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined 
Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”. 
 
The  “Minimal  Corresponding  Source”  for  a  Combined  Work  means  the 
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code 
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on 
the Application, and not on the Linked Version. 
 
The  “Corresponding  Application  Code”  for  a  Combined  Work  means  the 
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and 
utility  programs  needed  for  reproducing  the  Combined  Work  from  the 
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 
 
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
 
You  may  convey  a  covered  work  under  sections  3  and  4  of  this  License 
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
 
2. Conveying Modified Versions. 
 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

Wind River Confidential Information                                                                            Page 23 of 34                                                                                 Notice File Version 1.0 
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers 
to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility 
(other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you 
may convey a copy of the modified version: 
 
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure 
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the 
facility  still  operates,  and  performs  whatever  part  of  its  purpose  remains 
meaningful, or 
 
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License 
applicable to that copy. 
 
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. 
 
The  object  code  form  of  an  Application  may  incorporate  material  from  a 
header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under 
terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited 
to  numerical  parameters,  data  structure  layouts  and  accessors,  or  small 
macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do 
both of the following: 
 
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
 
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
document. 
 
4. Combined Works. 
 
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken 
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library 
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such 
modifications, if you also do each of the following: 
 
a)  Give  prominent  notice  with  each  copy  of  the  Combined  Work  that  the 
Library  is  used  in  it  and  that  the  Library  and  its  use  are  covered  by  this 
License. 
 
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
license document. 
 
c) For a Combined Work that displays  copyright notices during execution, 
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a 
reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license 
document. 
 
d) Do one of the following:  
 
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, 
and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under 
terms  that  permit,  the  user  to  recombine  or  relink  the  Application  with  a 
modified  version  of  the  Linked  Version  to  produce  a  modified  Combined 
Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
Corresponding Source. 
 
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library 
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly 
with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
Linked Version. 
 
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required 
to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the 
extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified 
version  of  the  Combined  Work  produced  by  recombining  or  relinking  the 
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 
4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding 
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must 
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the 
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 
 
5. Combined Libraries. 
 
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by 
side  in  a  single  library  together  with  other  library  facilities  that  are  not 
Applications  and  are  not  covered  by  this  License,  and  convey  such  a 
combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: 
 
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on 
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the 
terms of this License. 
 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work 
based  on  the  Library,  and  explaining  where  to  find  the  accompanying 
uncombined form of the same work. 
 
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. 
 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions 
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you 
received  it  specifies  that  a  certain  numbered  version  of  the  GNU  Lesser 
General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option 
of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you 
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General 
Public  License,  you  may choose any  version  of  the  GNU  Lesser General 
Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether 
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that 
proxy's  public  statement  of  acceptance  of  any  version  is  permanent 
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

3. Distribution Obligations. 
 
3.1. Application of License. 
 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed 
by  the  terms  of  this  License,  including  without  limitation  Section  2.2.  The 
Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the 
terms  of  this  License  or  a  future  version  of  this  License  released  under 
Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of 
the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on 
any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this 
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an 
additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.  
 
3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the 
same  media  as  an  Executable  version  or  via  an  accepted  Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version 
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must 
remain  available  for  at  least  twelve  (12)  months  after  the  date  it  initially 
became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are 
responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even 
if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.  
 
3.3. Description of Modifications. 
 
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file 
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the 
date  of  any  change.  You  must  include  a  prominent  statement  that  the 
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by 
the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the 
Source  Code,  and  (b)  in  any  notice  in  an  Executable  version  or  related 
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered 
Code.  
 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
 
(a)  Third Party Claims 
 
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual 
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor 
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 
Code  distribution  titled  "LEGAL"  which  describes  the  claim  and  the  party 
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. 
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available 
as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file 
in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps 
(such  as  notifying  appropriate  mailing  lists  or  newsgroups)  reasonably 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

knowledge has been obtained.  
 
(b) Contributor APIs 
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface 
and  Contributor  has  knowledge  of  patent  licenses  which  are  reasonably 
necessary  to  implement  that  API,  Contributor  must  also  include  this 
information in the legal file.  
 
(c) Representations. 
 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) 
above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's 
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.  
 
3.5. Required Notices. 
 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If 
it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its 
structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant 
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created 
one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the 
notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any 
documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or 
ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to 
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or 
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own 
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must 
make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability terms You offer.  
 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements 
of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, 
and  if  You  include  a  notice  stating  that  the  Source  Code  version  of  the 
Covered  Code  is  available  under  the  terms  of  this  License,  including  a 
description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. 
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable 
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' 
rights  relating  to  the  Covered  Code.  You  may  distribute  the  Executable 
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in 
compliance  with  the  terms  of  this  License  and  that  the  license  for  the 
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in 
the  Source  Code  version  from  the  rights  set  forth  in  this  License.  If  You 
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree 
to  indemnify  the  Initial  Developer  and  every  Contributor  for  any  liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such 
terms You offer.  
 
3.7. Larger Works. 
 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code 
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as 
a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of 
this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.  
 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with 
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or 
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the 
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they 
affect. Such description must be included in the legal file described in Section 
3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to 
the  extent  prohibited  by  statute  or  regulation,  such  description  must  be 
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  
5. Application of this License. 
 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the 
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.  
 
6. Versions of the License. 
 
6.1. New Versions 
Netscape  Communications  Corporation  ("Netscape")  may  publish  revised 
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be 
given a distinguishing version number.  
 
6.2. Effect of New Versions 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the 
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. 
You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than 
Netscape  has  the  right  to  modify  the  terms  applicable  to  Covered  Code 
created under this License.  
 
6.3. Derivative Works 
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only 
do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed 
by  this  License),  You  must  (a)  rename  Your  license  so  that  the  phrases 
"Mozilla",  "MOZILLAPL",  "MOZPL",  "Netscape",  "MPL",  "NPL"  or  any 
confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that 
your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that 
Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public 
License  and  Netscape  Public  License.  (Filling  in  the  name  of  the  Initial 
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A 
shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)  
 
7. Disclaimer of warranty 
 
Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without 
warranty  of  any  kind,  either  expressed  or implied,  including, without 
limitation,  warranties  that  the  covered  code  is  free  of  defects, 
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire 
risk as to the quality and performance of the covered code is with you. 
Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the 
initial  developer  or  any  other  contributor)  assume  the  cost  of  any 
necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty 
constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code 
is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.  
 
8. Termination 
 
8.1.  This  License  and  the  rights  granted  hereunder  will  terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail  to cure such 
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to 
the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination 
of  this  License.  Provisions  which,  by  their  nature,  must  remain  in  effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.  
 
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declatory  judgment  actions)  against  Initial  Developer  or  a  Contributor  (the 
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred 
to as "Participant") alleging that:  
 
such  Participant's  Contributor  Version  directly  or  indirectly  infringes  any 
patent,  then  any  and  all  rights  granted  by  such  Participant  to  You  under 
Sections  2.1  and/or  2.2  of  this  License  shall,  upon  60  days  notice  from 
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable 
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such 
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor 
Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable 
royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by 
                                                                                                                                WindSDKSupport  1.10  Third  Party  License

the  parties  or  the  litigation  claim  is  not  withdrawn,  the  rights  granted  by 
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at 
the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.  
any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor 
Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to 
You  by  such  Participant  under  Sections  2.1(b)  and  2.2(b)  are  revoked 
effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, 
Modifications made by that Participant.  
 
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that 
such  Participant's  Contributor  Version  directly  or  indirectly  infringes  any 
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior 
to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of 
the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be 
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or 
license.  
 
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user 
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall 
survive termination.  
 
9. Limitation of liability 
 
Under  no  circumstances  and  under  no  legal  theory,  whether  tort 
(including  negligence),  contract,  or  otherwise,  shall  you,  the  initial 
developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or 
any  supplier  of  any  of  such  parties,  be  liable  to  any  person  for  any 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
including,  without  limitation,  damages  for  loss  of  goodwill,  work 
stoppage,  computer  failure  or  malfunction,  or  any  and  all  other 
commercial  damages  or  losses,  even  if  such  party  shall  have  been 
informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability 
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from 
such  party's  negligence  to  the  extent  applicable  law  prohibits  such 
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation 
may not apply to you.  
 
10. U.S. government end users 
 
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101  (Oct.  1995),  consisting  of  "commercial  computer  software"  and 
"commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 
48  C.F.R.  12.212  (Sept.  1995).  Consistent  with  48  C.F.R.  12.212  and  48 
C.F.R.  227.7202-1  through  227.7202-4  (June  1995),  all  U.S.  Government 
End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 
  
11. Miscellaneous 
 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
hereof.  If  any  provision  of  this  License  is  held  to  be  unenforceable,  such 
provision  shall  be  reformed  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to  make  it 
enforceable.  This  License  shall  be  governed  by  California  law  provisions 
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its 
conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party 
is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United 
States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with 
venue  lying  in  Santa  Clara  County,  California,  with  the  losing  party 
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable 
attorneys'  fees  and  expenses.  The  application  of  the  United  Nations 
Convention  on  Contracts  for  the  International  Sale  of  Goods  is  expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract 
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  
 
12. Responsibility for claims 
 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of 
rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.  
13. Multiple-licensed code 
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-
Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you 
to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the 
alternative  licenses,  if  any,  specified  by  the  Initial  Developer  in  the  file 
described in Exhibit A.

by  the  terms  of  this  License,  including  without  limitation  Section  2.2.  The 
Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the 
terms  of  this  License  or  a  future  version  of  this  License  released  under 
Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of 
the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on 
any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this 
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an 
additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.  
 
3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the 
same  media  as  an  Executable  version  or  via  an  accepted  Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version 
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must 
remain  available  for  at  least  twelve  (12)  months  after  the  date  it  initially

became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are 
responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even 
if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.  
 
3.3. Description of Modifications. 
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file 
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the 
date  of  any  change.  You  must  include  a  prominent  statement  that  the 
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by 
the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the 
Source  Code,  and  (b)  in  any  notice  in  an  Executable  version  or  related 
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered 
Code.  
 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
(a) Third Party Claims 
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual 
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor 
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 
Code  distribution  titled  "LEGAL"  which  describes  the  claim  and  the  party 
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. 
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available 
as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file 
in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps 
(such  as  notifying  appropriate  mailing  lists  or  newsgroups)  reasonably 
calculated  to  inform  those  who  received  the  Covered  Code  that  new 
knowledge has been obtained.  
(b) Contributor APIs 
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface 
and  Contributor  has  knowledge  of  patent  licenses  which  are  reasonably 
necessary  to  implement  that  API,  Contributor  must  also  include  this 
information in the legal file.  
(c) Representations. 
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) 
above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's 
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.  
 
3.5. Required Notices. 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If 
it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its 
structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant 
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created 
one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the 
notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any 
documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or 
ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to 
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or 
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own 
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must 
make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability terms You offer.  
 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements 
of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, 
and  if  You  include  a  notice  stating  that  the  Source  Code  version  of  the 
Covered  Code  is  available  under  the  terms  of  this  License,  including  a 
description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. 
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable 
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' 
rights  relating  to  the  Covered  Code.  You  may  distribute  the  Executable 
version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in 
compliance  with  the  terms  of  this  License  and  that  the  license  for  the 
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in 
the  Source  Code  version  from  the  rights  set  forth  in  this  License.  If  You 
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree 
to  indemnify  the  Initial  Developer  and  every  Contributor  for  any  liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such 
terms You offer.  
 
3.7. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code 
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as 
a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of 
this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.  
 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with 
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or 
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the 
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they 
affect. Such description must be included in the legal file described in Section 
3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to 
the  extent  prohibited  by  statute  or  regulation,  such  description  must  be 
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  
 
5. Application of this License. 
 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the 
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 
  
6. Versions of the License. 
 
6.1. New Versions 
Netscape  Communications  Corporation  ("Netscape")  may  publish  revised 
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be 
given a distinguishing version number.  
 
6.2. Effect of New Versions 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the 
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. 
You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than 
Netscape  has  the  right  to  modify  the  terms  applicable  to  Covered  Code 
created under this License.  
 
6.3. Derivative Works 
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only 
do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed 
by  this  License),  You  must  (a)  rename  Your  license  so  that  the  phrases 
"Mozilla",  "MOZILLAPL",  "MOZPL",  "Netscape",  "MPL",  "NPL"  or  any 
confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that

Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public

7. Disclaimer of warranty 
 
Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without 
warranty  of  any  kind,  either  expressed  or implied,  including, without 
limitation,  warranties  that  the  covered  code  is  free  of  defects, 
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire 
risk as to the quality and performance of the covered code is with you. 
Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not the 
initial  developer  or  any  other  contributor)  assume  the  cost  of  any 
necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty 
constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code 
is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8.1.  This  License  and  the  rights  granted  hereunder  will  terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail  to cure such 
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to 
the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination 
of  this  License.  Provisions  which,  by  their  nature,  must  remain  in  effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.  
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declatory  judgment  actions)  against  Initial  Developer  or  a  Contributor  (the 
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred 
to as "Participant") alleging that:  
a.  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to 
You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 
days  notice  from  Participant  terminate  prospectively,  unless  if 
within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing 
to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your 
past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or 
(ii)  withdraw  Your litigation claim  with  respect  to  the  Contributor 
Version  against  such  Participant.  If  within  60  days  of  notice,  a 
reasonable  royalty  and  payment  arrangement  are  not  mutually 
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not 
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 
2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 
day notice period specified above.  
b.  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's 
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then 
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) 
and  2.2(b)  are  revoked  effective  as  of  the  date  You  first  made, 
used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that 
Participant.  
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that 
such  Participant's  Contributor  Version  directly  or  indirectly  infringes  any 
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior 
to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of 
the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be 
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or 
license.  
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user 
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall 
survive termination.  
 
9. Limitation of liability 
 
Under  no  circumstances  and  under  no  legal  theory,  whether  tort 
(including  negligence),  contract,  or  otherwise,  shall  you,  the  initial 
developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or 
any  supplier  of  any  of  such  parties,  be  liable  to  any  person  for  any 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
including,  without  limitation,  damages  for  loss  of  goodwill,  work 
stoppage,  computer  failure  or  malfunction,  or  any  and  all  other 
commercial  damages  or  losses,  even  if  such  party  shall  have  been 
informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability 
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from 
such  party's  negligence  to  the  extent  applicable  law  prohibits  such 
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation 
may not apply to you. 
 
10. U.S. government end users 
 
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101  (Oct.  1995),  consisting  of  "commercial  computer  software"  and 
"commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 
48  C.F.R.  12.212  (Sept.  1995).  Consistent  with  48  C.F.R.  12.212  and  48 
C.F.R.  227.7202-1  through  227.7202-4  (June  1995),  all  U.S.  Government 
End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 
  
11. Miscellaneous 
 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
hereof.  If  any  provision  of  this  License  is  held  to  be  unenforceable,  such 
provision  shall  be  reformed  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to  make  it 
enforceable.  This  License  shall  be  governed  by  California  law  provisions 
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its 
conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party 
is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United 
States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with 
venue  lying  in  Santa  Clara  County,  California,  with  the  losing  party 
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable 
attorneys'  fees  and  expenses.  The  application  of  the  United  Nations 
Convention  on  Contracts  for  the  International  Sale  of  Goods  is  expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract 
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  
 
12. Responsibility for claims 
 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of 
rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. 
  
13. Multiple-licensed code 
 
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-
Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you 
to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the 
alternative  licenses,  if  any,  specified  by  the  Initial  Developer  in  the  file

license: 
 
under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable 
by  such  Contributor  to  use,  reproduce,  make  available,  modify,  display,

License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution 
or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section

for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or 
 
for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications

software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or 
 
under  Patent  Claims  infringed  by  Covered  Software  in  the  absence  of  its 
Contributions. 
 
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or 
logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the 
notice requirements in Section 3.4). 
 
2.4. Subsequent Licenses 
 
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute 
the  Covered  Software  under  a  subsequent  version  of  this  License  (see 
Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under 
the terms of Section 3.3).

are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its 
Contributions conveyed by this License. 
 
2.6. Fair Use

copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

Sections  3.1,  3.2,  3.3,  and  3.4  are  conditions  of  the  licenses  granted  in 
Section 2.1. 
 
3. Responsibilities 
 
3.1. Distribution of Source Form 
 
All  distribution  of  Covered  Software  in  Source  Code  Form,  including  any 
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the 
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form 
of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how 
they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict 
the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form. 
 
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form 
 
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: 
 
such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, 
as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable 
Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable 
means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution 
to the recipient; and 
 
You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or 
sublicense  it  under  different  terms,  provided  that  the  license  for  the 
Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the 
Source Code Form under this License. 
 
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work 
 
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, 
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the 
Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software 
with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered 
Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits 
You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such 
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their 
option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this 
License or such Secondary License(s). 
 
3.4. Notices 
 
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including 
copyright  notices,  patent  notices,  disclaimers  of  warranty,  or  limitations  of 
liability) contained within the Source Code  Form of the Covered Software, 
except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy 
known factual inaccuracies. 
 
3.5. Application of Additional Terms 
 
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity 
or  liability  obligations  to  one  or  more  recipients  of  Covered  Software. 
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any 
Contributor.  You  must  make  it  absolutely  clear  that  any  such  warranty, 
support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such 
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You 
offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of 
liability specific to any jurisdiction. 
 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation 
 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with 
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, 
or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the 
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they 
affect.  Such  description  must  be  placed  in  a  text  file  included  with  all 
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent 
prohibited  by  statute  or  regulation,  such  description  must  be  sufficiently 
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
 
5. Termination 
 
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You 
fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then 
the  rights  granted  under  this  License  from  a  particular  Contributor  are 
reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and 
finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor 
fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 
60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants 
from  a  particular  Contributor  are  reinstated  on  an  ongoing  basis  if  such 
Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, 
this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this 
License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days 
after Your receipt of the notice. 
 
5.2.  If  You  initiate  litigation  against  any  entity  by  asserting  a  patent 
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, 
and  cross-claims)  alleging  that  a  Contributor  Version  directly  or  indirectly 
infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors 
for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 
 
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user 
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been 
validly  granted  by  You  or  Your  distributors  under  this  License  prior  to 
termination shall survive termination. 
 
6. Disclaimer of Warranty 
 
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without 
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without 
limitation,  warranties  that  the  Covered  Software  is  free  of  defects, 
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as 
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should 
any  Covered  Software  prove  defective  in  any  respect,  You  (not  any 
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. 
This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No 
use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under 
this disclaimer. 
 
7. Limitation of Liability 
 
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including 
negligence),  contract,  or  otherwise,  shall  any  Contributor,  or  anyone  who 
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any 
direct,  indirect,  special,  incidental,  or  consequential  damages  of  any 
character  including,  without  limitation,  damages  for  lost  profits,  loss  of 
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other 
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed 
of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to 
liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to 
the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not 
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so 
this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. 
 
8. Litigation 
 
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a 
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and 
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference 
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s 
ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims. 
 
9. Miscellaneous 
 
This  License  represents  the  complete  agreement  concerning  the  subject 
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, 
such  provision  shall  be  reformed  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to  make  it 
enforceable.  Any  law  or  regulation  which  provides  that  the  language  of  a 
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe 
this License against a Contributor.

no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new 
versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version

10.3. Modified Versions 
 
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create 
a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version 
of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the 
name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs 
from this License).

Notes 
 
This  version:  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-
20021231 
 
This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 
2002.  This version  removes the copyright  ownership  notice such that this 
license  can  be  used  with  materials  other  than  those  owned  by  the  W3C, 
reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this 
specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of 
"use".  Otherwise, this  version  is  the  same  as  the  previous version  and  is 
written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL 
compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. 
Vim License 
Version:   
Common Name:  Vim 
 
License Text: 
VIM LICENSE 
 
I) There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except 
that they must include this license text. You can also distribute unmodified 
parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must include this license 
text. You are also allowed to include executables that  you made from  the 
unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts. 
 
II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim, including 
executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions are met: 
 
1) This license text must be included unmodified. 
 
2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways: 
 
a)  If you make changes  to  Vim  yourself, you must  clearly  describe  in the 
distribution how to contact you. When the maintainer asks you (in any way) 
for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you must make your changes, 
including source code, available to the maintainer without fee. The maintainer 
reserves the right to include your changes in the official version of Vim. What 
the maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they will be 
distributed is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then this license, or 
a later version, also applies to your changes. The current maintainer is Bram 
Moolenaar  <Bram@vim.org>.  If  this  changes  it  will  be  announced  in 
appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors). 
When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to 
send him your changes ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he 
has received your changes they will not have to be sent again. 
 
b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as mentioned 
under a) you are allowed to further distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at 
I). If you make additional changes the text under a) applies to those changes. 
 
c) Provide  all the changes,  including  source code,  with  every copy  of the 
modified Vim you distribute. This may be done in the form of a context diff. 
You can choose what license to use for new code you add. The changes and 
their license must not restrict others from making their own changes to the 
official version of Vim. 
 
d)  When you  have  a  modified Vim  which  includes changes  as mentioned 
under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the changes if the 
following three conditions are met: 
- The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute the changes 
to  the  Vim  maintainer  without  fee  or  restriction,  and  permits  the  Vim 
maintainer to include the changes in the official version of Vim without fee or 
restriction. 
-  You  keep  the  changes  for  at  least  three  years  after  last  distributing  the 
corresponding  modified  Vim.  When  the  maintainer  or  someone  who  you 
distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes within 
this period, you must make them available to him. 
-  You clearly  describe  in  the  distribution  how  to contact  you.  This contact 
information must remain valid for at least three years after last distributing the 
corresponding modified Vim, or as long as possible. 
 
e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes, you 
can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later 
version. 
 
3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version" command 
and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim is able to see 
that it was modified. When distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the 
message is only required for as far as this does not conflict with the license 
used for the changes. 
 
4)  The  contact  information  as  required  under  2)a)  and  2)d)  must  not  be 
removed or changed, except that the person himself can make corrections. 
 
III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the 
Vim license for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, 
including the source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by 
uploading  the  files  to  a  server  and  e-mailing  the  URL.  If  the  number  of 
changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will do. 
The e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org> 
 
IV) It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the  Vim 
sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use this license for 
previous  Vim  releases  instead  of  the  license that  they  came  with,  at your 
option.

DISCLAIMER  OF  WARRANTIES:    WIND  RIVER  AND  ITS  LICENSORS 
DISCLAIM  ALL  WARRANTIES,  EXPRESS,  IMPLIED  AND  STATUTORY 
INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  THE  IMPLIED  WARRANTIES  OF 
MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE,  TITLE 
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT 
TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION 
OR  ADVICE  GIVEN  BY  WIND  RIVER,  ITS  DEALERS,  DISTRIBUTORS, 
AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE 
OF  THIS  WARRANTY.    Some  jurisdictions  do  not  allow  the  limitation  or 
exclusion of implied warranties or how long an implied warranty may last, so 
the  above  limitations  may  not  apply  to  Customer.    This  warranty  gives 
Customer specific legal rights and Customer may have other rights that vary 
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 
 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL 
NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR 
INDIRECT  DAMAGES  OF  ANY  KIND  (INCLUDING  DAMAGES  FOR

THE  POSSIBILITY  OF  SUCH  DAMAGES.  IN  NO  EVENT  WILL  WIND 
RIVER’S  AGGREGATE  CUMULATIVE  LIABILITY  FOR  ANY  CLAIMS 
ARISING  OUT  OF  OR  RELATED  TO  OPEN  SOURCE   SOFTWARE 
EXCEED ONE  HUNDRED  DOLLARS  ($100).    Some  jurisdictions  do  not 
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so 
this limitation and exclusion may not apply to Customer. 
 
THE WARRANTY  DISCLAIMER  AND  LIMITED  LIABILITY  ARE 
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN 
WIND RIVER AND CUSTOMER.  WIND RIVER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
PROVIDE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.
